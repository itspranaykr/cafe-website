                        <p>After a post-grad in marketing, and a couple months in a 9-5 gig, our founder pranay thakur, realised his affinity to the food industry. And like a true Foodpreneur, he went after this epiphany with all he had. And that crazy zeal, friends, has evolved from a cozy cafe in central Connaught Place into the thriving food chain that we all love today, brunvh. Starting and most importantly sustaining a restaurant in a cut-throat yet continuously evolving marketplace like Delhi comes with its own learnings, and currently with the smooth operational style of brunch, we can say pranay is well-equipped with the Logistical as well as Executive skill sets required to keep brunch always brimming with happy customers.</p>
